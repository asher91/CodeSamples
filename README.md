# CodeSamples
 
C#: I personally enjoy developing libraries/modules for reusage, this is a module which can be used to authenticate users and setup their sessions etc.
MsSQL: Alongside the C# project, this MsSQL project provides the means to persist authentication details. 
TypeScript: I mostly uses TypeScript to build AngularJS frontend base instead of writing plain JS.
Katalon: Not a language but rather a tool for automation testing, this is an RND on katalon. 
PHP: Spinner Demo project: https://github.com/asher91/spinner.git

Python, C, VB.NET, Visual Basic 6.0, Scheme, Erlang, Prolog
